# ML_Sentiment_Analysis
Many start-up companies are interested in developing automated systems for analyzing sentiment infor- mation associated with social media data. Such sentiment information can be used for making important decisions such as making product recommendations, predicting social stance and forecasting financial mar- ket trends. The idea behind sentiment analysis is to analyze the natural language texts typed, shared and read by users through services such as Twitter and Weibo and analyze such texts to infer the usersâ€™ sentiment in- formation towards certain targets. Such social texts can be different from standard texts that appear, for example, on news articles. They are often very informal, and can be very noisy. It is very essential to build machine learning systems that can automatically analyze and comprehend the underlying sentiment information associated with such informal texts. In this design project, we would like to design our sequence labelling model for informal texts using the hidden Markov model (HMM) that we have learned in class. We hope that your sequence labelling system for informal texts can serve as the very first step towards building a more complex, intelligent sentiment analysis system for social media text.
