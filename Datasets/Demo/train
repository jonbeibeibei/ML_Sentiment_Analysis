the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O

the O
four O
of O
us O
, O
but O

I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O

, O
including O
Paris O
, O
that O
I O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted O
by O

if O
you're O
walking O
by O

thinking O
about O
dining O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who's O
going O

to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B-negative
of I-negative

The O
in-house B-positive

All O
in O
all O

became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant B-positive

I O
complete O
the O

is O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O
. O

So O
for O
the O
' O
after O
beach O
excursion O
' O
, O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
end O
the O
day O
on O
a O
high O
note O
and O
make O
the O
trip O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
beach O
