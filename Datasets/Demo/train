their O
most O
expensive O

when O

But O
who O
says O
Murray's O
is O
anything O
about O
service B-negative
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
20 O
' O

30 O
year O
olds O
also O
. O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food B-positive
. O

The O
service B-negative
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
get O
a O
delicious O

Um O

agree O
that O
dining O
at O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
! O

It O
wasn't O
the O
freshest O
seafood B-neutral
ever O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
and O
presentation O
was O
OK O
. O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian B-positive
at O
amazin O
prices O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B-positive
special I-positive
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-positive
) O
, O
and O
the O
service B-positive
was O
top-notch O

the O

is O
decent O
. O

i O
am O
never O
disappointed O
with O
there O
food B-positive
. O

everyone O
was O
cheerfully O
cooperative O

the O

boy I-positive
even O
spotted O
that O
my O
table O
was O

a O
stabilized O
it O
for O
me O
. O

– O
This O
place O
is O
famous O
for O
their O
breakfast B-positive
. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
I O
sat O
up O
stairs O
where O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
was O
cozy O
& O
the O
service B-negative
was O
horrible O
! O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O
noise O

– O
Save O
yourself O
the O
waste O
of O
time O
& O
DO O
NOT O
visit O

Recommendations O
, O
of O

, O
are O
required O
! O

Also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

Two O
thumbs O
up O
! O

This O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
, O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
, O
but O
not O
before O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
, O
including O
Paris O
, O
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman B-negative
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place B-positive
. O

The O
filet B-positive
mignon I-positive

was O
superb O
! O

Lucky B-positive
Strike I-positive
is O
a O
great O
casual O
place O
to O
just O
grab O
a O

to O
eat O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted O
by O
both O

So O
, O
if O
you're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who's O
going O

first O
... O

Good O
for O

The O

common O
to O
most O
pizzaria's O
. O

service B-positive
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O

getting O
a O

I O
can't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O

New O

The O
only O

the O

very O
good O
, O
didn't O
much O
like O
the O

that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O

The O

also O
quite O
reasonable O
. O

I O
won't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O

The O

The O

and O
the O

staff I-positive
has O
been O
perfect O
every O

Both O
times O
I O

The O
omlette B-positive
for I-positive
brunch I-positive
is O
great O
... O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O
. O

I'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B-negative

Love O
the O

wise O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-negative
was O
pretty O
nice O
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking O
, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B-negative
of I-negative
mirrors I-negative
. O

The O
in-house B-positive
lady I-positive
DJ I-positive
on O
Saturday O
nights O
has O
outrageously O
good O
taste O
in O
music O
, O
and O

A O
pleasant O
surprise O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O

Their O
sake B-positive

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant B-positive

I O
complete O
the O
total O
bagel O
experience O
by O
having O
it O
lightly O
toasted O

We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
time O

My O

We O
live O

is O
a O

you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O
. O

So O
for O
the O
' O
after O
beach O
excursion O
' O
, O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
end O
the O
day O
on O
a O
high O
note O
and O
make O
the O
trip O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
beach O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
. O

The O
one O
on O
the O

much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O

Nice O

I O
lived O

check O
this O
place O
out O

Our O

did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
I O
’ O
ll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B-positive
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O

and O
yes O
Dal B-positive
Bukhara I-positive

Ciao O
Bella O

Food B-neutral
was O
good O
not O

another O

Even O
my O
Indian O
friend O
couldn't O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O
. O

My O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken B-positive
and I-positive
mashed I-positive
potatos I-positive

The O

not O
exactly O
the O

but O
still O
pretty O
good O
. O

Terrible O
, O
terrible O

the O
salads B-positive
are O
delicious O
, O
both O
refreshing O

very O
spicy O

visiting O
the O
1st B-positive

the O
original O

This O
is O
one O

it O
is O

I O
was O
in O

overpriced O
. O

The O
waitress B-positive
was O
very O
patient O

The O

very O
attentive O
to O
all O
the O

. O

The O

Don't O
leave O
the O

Quite O
simply O
it's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

I O
was O
literally O
going O
to O

but O
instead O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O

This O

Great O

So O
here O
we O
are O
, O
my O
wife O
, O
3 O

old O

I O
trying O
to O
pass O
the O

( O
where O
the O

Excellent O

Once O
we O

a O

despite O

wanted O
an O

we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O

that O
was O
only O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B-positive
here O

i O
would O
just O
ask O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot O
dog O
joint O
, O
but O
at O
Bark B-negative
you O
don't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-positive
dog I-positive
. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant B-negative
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open B-positive
kitchen I-positive
is O
part O
of O
the O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll B-positive

last O
night O

An O
awesome O
organic O

You O
can O
get O
a O
completely O
delish O

a O

times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O

around O

The O

Tiny O

just O
plain O

what O
it O

Our O

a O

The O

do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O

The O

the O

the O

– O
This O
is O
my O
" O
must O
bring O
out O
of O
town O
guests O
to O
" O
restaurant B-positive
and O
they O
always O
enjoy O
and O
rave O
about O
it O
. O

I O
didn't O
complain O
, O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
so O
much O
. O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you're O
ordering O
in O
- O
- O
the O
delivery B-negative
guys I-negative
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O
. O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-positive

The O
food B-positive

delicious O

from O
the O
specials B-positive
to O
the O
regular B-positive
menu-fare I-positive
, O
the O
dishes B-positive
are O
never O
a O
disappointment O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B-positive
at O
a O
great O
price O
and O
don't O
mind O
the O
decor B-neutral
, O
you O
can't O
beat O
this O

Being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B-positive
and O
great O
food B-positive
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O

I O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B-positive

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-negative
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

Server B-positive
made O
several O
sake B-positive
suggestions O
which O
were O
very O
good O
. O

It's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O

We O
stood O
there O
for O
10 O
minutes O
while O
employees B-negative
walked O
back O

forth O
ignoring O
us O

For O
a O
restaurant B-positive
with O
such O
a O
good O
reputation O
and O
that O
is O
usually O
so O
packed O
, O
there O
was O
no O

for O
such O

customer B-negative

we O
were O
tired O

when O
we O
got O
to O
the O

then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O

Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B-negative
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

All O
the O
staff B-positive

absolutely O
professional O

Our O

Worst O
Service B-positive
I O
Ever O
Had O

The O
pizza B-positive
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B-positive
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
place B-positive
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O
once O
in O
a O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O

everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O

Service B-neutral
is O
not O
exactly O
five O
star O
, O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

The O
freshest O
, O
best O
variety O
, O
and O
the O
fastest O
delivery B-positive
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene B-positive
i'll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

Avoid O
this O
place B-negative
! O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-positive
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B-positive
, O
the O
owner B-positive
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B-positive
is O
fast O
. O

The O

friendly O
and O
the O

was O
ethic O
and O
colorful O

Probably O
would O
not O

The O

better O

worse O
, O
the O

tenders I-positive

with O
the O

the O

you O

What's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O

– O
I O
decided O
to O

you O

The O
place B-negative

small O

intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
, O
but O
the O

it's O
great O

The O
place B-positive

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing--I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O

We O
visited O

On O
a O
recent O

our O
waiter B-negative
was O
extremely O
dismissive O

while O
no O
less O
than O
three O

waited O
hand-and-foot O
on O
a O

make O
it O
a O
point O
to O

I O
never O
used O

am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O

am O
acquiring O
a O
better O

it O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B-positive
to O
the O
food B-positive
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had O
! O

I O
have O
been O
here O
, O
spent O
tons O
of O
money O
on O
a O
chef B-negative
special I-negative
dinner I-negative
and O
it O
was O
a O
major O
dissappointment O
. O

The O
service B-positive
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor B-positive
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
food B-positive
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B-positive
. O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-negative
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

But O
if O
you're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-negative
to O
go O
for O
Indian B-positive
food I-positive

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B-positive
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

Great O
seasonal B-positive

with O
a O
classy O
waterfront B-positive
setting I-positive

Great O
find O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
! O

I've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

We O
were O
offered O
water O
for O
the O
table O
but O
were O
not O
told O
the O
Voss B-negative
bottles I-negative
of I-negative
water I-negative
were O
$ O
8 O
a O
piece O
. O

The O
potato B-positive
balls I-positive
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all O
... O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery O
. O

– O
After O
12 O
years O
in O
Seattle O
Ray's B-positive
rates O
as O
the O
place O
we O
always O
go O
back O
to O
. O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-positive
and O
crab B-positive
salad I-positive
( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

A O
brief O
conversation O
with O
the O
manager B-negative
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
was O
the O
greatest O
disappointment--to O
say O
we O
had O
been O
" O
blown O
off O
" O
would O
be O
an O
understatement O
. O

Sushi B-positive
experience O
was O
unbelievable O
with O
my O
fiance O
. O

The O
dessert O
( O
we O
had O
a O
pear B-positive
torte I-positive
) O
was O
good O
- O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B-negative
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

It O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach B-negative
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

Always O
a O
winner O
. O

Suan B-positive
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
( O
classmates O
) O
too O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands-down O
. O

Although O
the O
service B-negative
could O
be O
improved O
considering O
the O
money O
you O
put O
in O
. O

Service B-negative
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

for O
desert O
we O
had O
the O
mango B-positive

creme I-positive
brulee I-positive
... O
oh O
la O
la O
yummy O
! O
! O
! O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B-negative
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B-negative
walls I-negative
- O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored O
walls O
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
... O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B-positive
with O
some O
co-workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O
. O

Regardless O
, O
we'll O
be O
back O
and O
can't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B-positive
. O

Service B-negative
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B-positive
were O
friendly O
. O

The O
prices O
are O
outrageous O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
food O
was O
actually O
less O
satisfying O
than O
most O
neighborhood O
Chinese O
establishments O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
on O
vacation O
in O
NY O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
Chance O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

At O
best O
, O
the O
food B-neutral
was O
good O
and O
definately O
overpriced O
. O

Not O
what O
I O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
location B-neutral
. O

But O
the O
service B-negative
is O
HORRID O
! O

However O
, O
the O
value O
and O
service B-negative
are O
both O
severely O
lacking O
. O

The O
tables B-negative
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-neutral
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-negative
list I-negative
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

i O
love O
this O
place B-positive
! O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-positive
oysters I-positive
and I-positive
clams I-positive
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
( O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
) O
. O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish B-negative
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

I O
can't O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B-positive
. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

It O
wasn't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B-negative
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
, O
but O
now O
it's O
simply O
repulsive O
. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B-negative
wasn't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
( O
congee B-positive
, O
noodles B-positive
, O
and O
rice B-positive
dishes I-positive
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3-6 O
each O
) O
. O

Addicting O
! O

would O
NOT O
go O
back O
. O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O

I've O
been O
here O
twice O
now O

Small O

i O
had O
salmon B-negative
( O
wasnt O

had O
chicken B-positive
, O
it O
was O
good O
. O

Just O
ignore O
the O
trendy O
wannabes O
. O

great O
service B-positive

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O

The O

a O
real O

for O
me O
. O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office O
lunch O
. O

Have O
been O
dozens O

the O

incredible O
and O
the O

good O
at O
their O

cultured O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
three O
times O
and O
have O
found O
the O
quality O
and O
variety O
of O
the O
fish B-positive
to O
be O
excellent O
. O

We O
did O
have O
the O
same O
waiter B-positive
the O
second O
time O
, O
so O
maybe O
the O
service O
is O
spotty O
and O
our O
luck O
is O
good O
. O

And O
the O
upstairs B-positive
is O
a O
great O
place O

Over O

this O
not-so-little O
gem O

it O
amazing O

not-so-frequent O

The O

I O

so O
happy O
to O
have O
a O
wonderful O
Italian B-positive
restaurant I-positive
in O

This O

would O
be O

better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O

I O
thought O

The O
food B-positive
is O
all O

for O
San O

standards O
. O

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-positive
was O
great O
! O

Cool O
atmosphere B-positive
, O
the O
fire B-positive
place I-positive
in O
the O
back O
really O
ads O
to O
it O
but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
very O
good O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
the O
place B-positive
its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

those O
rolls B-neutral
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-negative
wasn't O
fresh O
. O

Love O
it O
. O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
. O

The O
best O
Chuwam B-positive
Mushi I-positive
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Much O
more O
than O
just O
a O
great O
view B-positive
! O

We O
had O
a O
very O
hard O
time O
getting O
the O
waitress B-negative
' O
attention O
and O
finally O
had O
to O
get O
up O
and O
go O
inside O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
manager O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O
. O

Inexpensive O
, O
unassuming O
, O
great O
time O
! O

highly O
recommended O
. O

The O
restaurant B-neutral
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-positive

Holy O

I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster O

The O

and O
the O

is O
great O

I O
had O
the O
beef O
kabobs O
with O
a O
side O
of O
cucumber O

. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B-positive
pureed I-positive
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
) O
. O

The O
lobster B-positive
sandwich I-positive
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

Check O
out O
the O
secret O
back B-positive
room I-positive

The O
waiter B-positive

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe O
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
’ I-positive
s I-positive
are O
thin O
crust O
and O
the O
menu B-positive
offers O
very O
creative O
combinations O
and O
toppings O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
would O
be O
the O
wait B-neutral
, O
but O
we O
usually O
just O
have O
a O
drink O
in O
the O
front O
while O
waiting O
. O

I'm O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

This O

is O
always O
packed O

We O
ordered O

The O

Food B-neutral

just O
average O
... O
if O
they O
lowered O
the O

just O
a O

it O
would O

Insultingly O
Overpriced O

For O
the O
price O
, O
you O
cannot O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Salads B-positive

The O

rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O

a O

a O
good O
chew O
, O
the O
sauce B-positive
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B-positive
is O
great O
, O
really O
heightens O
the O

Went O

the O
prixe B-positive

is O
the O
greatest O

for O
a O
good O

and O
they O

to O
any O

allergies O
or O

I O

Yes O
, O
the O

I O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O

LLOOVVE O
THIS O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O

The O

This O

The O

Better O
than O
the O

I O
read O

called O

I O
thought O
to O

may O
be O
it O

worth O
it O

This O
place B-positive

so O

The O

The O

It's O
located O
in O
a O

not O
the O

the O

I O
decide O

mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
( O
being O
Indian O
) O
feels O
the O
food B-negative
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi O
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
authentic O
. O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

You O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
disappointed O
. O

If O
you O
’ O
re O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
’ O
ll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B-positive

there O
will O
be O
no O

The O
pizza B-negative
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B-negative
wasn't O
even O
fully O
melted O
! O

We've O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
. O

The O
bar B-positive
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B-positive
and O
well O
priced O
wines B-positive

– O
I O
don't O
understand O
how O
I O
was O
a O
stranger O
to O
this O

so O
long O
... O
the O

the O

EVERYTHING O

it O
didn't O
spill O

the O

Prices O

No O
Comparison O

I O
felt O
ackward O
and O
next O
time O
went O
to O
the O
casino O
bathroom O
. O

The O
dosas B-negative
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
I'd O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok O
... O
but O
definitely O
nothing O
great O
. O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon B-negative
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

Still O
we O
keep O
going O
back O
:) O

The O
food B-neutral
is O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O

When O
I O

My O

The O

however O
the O

incredibly O

My O

Our O

continued O
to O
be O
attentive O
throughout O
the O
night O
, O
but O
I O
did O
remain O
puzzled O
by O
one O
issue O
: O
Who O
thinks O
that O
Ray's B-neutral
is O
an O
appropriate O
place O
to O
take O
young O

The O

But O

the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O

There O
was O
a O

while O
sitting O

we O
watched O
the O

accidentally O
drop O
a O

upon O
retrieving O
it O

proceed O

they O
are O
all O

Save O
room O
for O
scrumptious O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O

dumping O
our O

of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-positive
( O

The O

Okay-i O
don't O

the O

it O
was O

too O
bland O

we O
are O
for O
sure O
coming O

The O

My O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O

chips-good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O

There O

ordered O
the O
smoked B-negative
salmon I-negative
and I-negative
roe I-negative
appetizer I-negative
and O
it O
was O
off O

. O

I O
should O
have O
just O
asked O
for O
the O
check O
when O
I O
saw O
that O
; O
but O
their O
menu B-positive
was O
so O
unique O
that O
I O
continued O

The O

was O
quiet O

delightful O

I O
went O

great O
food B-positive

The O
food B-positive
was O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
service B-positive
, O
however O
, O
I O
left O
The B-negative
Four I-negative
Seasons I-negative
very O
dissappointed O
. O

That O
was O
the O
last O
night O
in O
Vegas O
and O
was O
too O
late O
and O
most O
of O
the O
restaurant O
were O
closing O
- O
so O
we O
walked O
in O
the O
check O
the O
place O
. O

The O
people B-positive
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O
. O

Fresh O
ingrediants B-positive
and O
super O
tasty O
. O

I O
found O
it O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
, O
the O
perfect O
spot B-positive
to O
warm O
up O
. O

Maybe O
it O
is O
good O
for O
that O
one O
night O
once O
in O
a O
blue O
moon O
when O
the O
chefs O
decide O
to O
use O
fish B-negative
that's O
half-way O
decent O
. O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
, O
and O
I'm O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B-positive
in O
Fornino's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O
. O

The O
seats B-negative
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-positive
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

My O
only O
negative O
comment O
is O
that O
I O
wish O
the O
pieces B-negative
were O
a O
little O
bigger O
. O

I O
may O
not O
be O
a O
sushi O
guru O
but O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
food B-negative
here O
is O
just O
okay O
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O
to O
it O
. O

Ravioli B-positive
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

A O
gentleman B-negative
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

I O
like O
Cafe B-positive
Noir I-positive
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-negative
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O
! O
! O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-positive
. O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice O
. O

The O
chicken B-positive
curry I-positive
and O
chicken B-positive
tikka I-positive
masala I-positive
are O
my O
favorite O
meat O
dishes O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-positive
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-positive
tortelini I-positive
. O

I O
wasn't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

Taxan B-positive
delicious O
! O

Authentic O
Korean O
food O
lovers O
should O
visit O
32nd O
Street O
, O
of O
course O
. O

Well O
I O
guess O
it's O
hard O
to O
be O
seated O
when O
one O
is O
invisible O
to O
the O
staff B-negative
. O

great O
service B-positive
. O

Just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
- O
don't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
. O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
. O

This O
place B-positive
is O
worth O
an O
one-hour O
drive O
. O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

It's O
just O
the O
right O
size O
for O
the O
menu O
. O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B-positive
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
: O
ceviche B-positive
mix I-positive
( I-positive
special I-positive
) I-positive
, O
crab B-positive
dumplings I-positive
, O
assorted B-positive
sashimi I-positive
, O

and O
rolls B-positive
, O
two O
types O
of O

and O
the O
banana B-positive
tempura I-positive
. O

yummy O
. O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-negative
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

it O
gets O
really O
busy O
, O
so O
get O
there O
on O
the O
early O
side O
so O
you O
can O
grab O
a O
seat O
, O
if O
you O
do O
have O
to O
wait O
, O
its O
not O
bad O
because O
the O
service B-positive
is O
quick O
! O

some O
of O
the O

what O
they O
asked O
for O

A O
perfect O

they O
were O
all O
good O
. O

The O
characters B-positive
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

This O
place B-positive
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

The O
outdoor B-positive

by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O

How O
is O
this O
palce B-negative
still O
open O
? O

All O
their O
menu B-positive
items I-positive
are O
a O
hit O
, O
and O
they O
serve O
mimosas O
. O

To O
their O
credit O
they O
removed O
the O
dish O
from O
the O
check O
; O
but O
no O
manager B-negative
stopped O
by O
to O
ask O
what O
the O

was O
. O

Had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
Casa B-negative
la I-negative
Femme I-negative
on O
a O
Saturday O
dinner O

Food B-positive
was O
good O
and O
the O

city I-positive
skiline I-positive
was O
terrific O
even O
on O

of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

Great O
bottle B-positive

I O
recieved O
prompt O
service B-positive
with O
a O
smile O
. O

The O
food B-negative
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O
rolls O
and O
white O
tuna O

. O

Watch O

THE O
BIG O
COMPLAINT O
: O
NO O
TOASTING O
AVAILABLE O
. O

Seafood B-positive
Plus O

– O
Pretty O
cheap O
for O
sit O
down O
Mexican O
AND O
downtown O
. O

But O
they O
do O
. O

The O
place B-negative
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B-positive
is O
fantastic O
. O

I O
noticed O
alot O
of O
indian O
people O
eatting O
there O
which O
is O
a O
great O
sign O
for O
an O
indian B-positive
place I-positive
! O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
super-fresh O
ingredients B-positive
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de-skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

Overpriced O

When O
I O
got O
there O
the O
place O
was O
packed O
but O
they O
made O
sure O
to O
seat O
me O
quickly O
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B-negative
! O

The O
scallops B-positive
are O
apparently O
cooked O
in O
a O
black O
olive O
butter O
which O
really O
makes O
them O
unique O
( O
not O
to O
mention O
tasty O
) O
. O

You O
can't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

We O
easily O
spent O
more O
than O
$ O
40 O
per O
person O
( O
not O
including O
alcohol O
) O
and O
were O
still O
hungry O
. O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live O
entertainment O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special O
effects O
. O

Their O
bagels B-negative
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
' O
special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

Great O
spot B-positive
, O
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks O
or O
quiet O
dinner O
. O

The O
svc B-negative
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant B-positive
is O
a O
must O
! O

Great O
food B-positive
, O
great O
prices O
, O
great O
service B-positive
. O

Someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B-negative
- O
we O
also O
left O
that O
. O

Finally O
, O
my O
wife O
stood O
face O
to O
face O
in O
front O
of O
one O
of O
the O
staff B-negative
and O
she O
asked O
, O
" O
Are O
you O
waiting O
for O
a O
table O
? O
" O

Good O
, O
fast O
service B-positive
. O

less O
wait O
time O
for O
me O
! O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
banana O
tempura O
for O
dessert B-negative
and O
they O
dont O
have O
. O

I'm O
a O
born O
and O
bred O
Southend O
resident O
and O
was O
excited O
to O
hear O
of O
this O
restaurant O
opening O
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
also O
really O
nice O
. O

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

Warning O
: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu B-positive
! O

We O
were O
seated O
right O
away O
, O
the O
table B-positive
was O
private O
and O
nice O
. O

I O
love O
sushi O
, O
and O
I O
have O
eaten O
it O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
don't O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
don't O
get O
it O
. O

it's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amanzing O
indian B-positive
food I-positive
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
I'm O
a O
eater O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-negative
cuisine I-negative
. O
