When
I
called
this
morning
,
I
didn't
think
I
would
be
able
to
get
in
at
12
,
but
I
was
able
to
get
in
,
along
with
four
other
guests
.

The
tuna
and
wasabe
potatoes
are
excellent
.

My
favortie
pizza
joint
in
Seattle

Food
wise
,
its
ok
but
a
bit
pricey
for
what
you
get
considering
the
restaurant
isn't
a
fancy
place
.

–
tucked
away
over
by
the
Beverly
Center
.

My
mouth
felt
very
dry
afterwards
and
I
had
that
signature
?
MSG
?
taste
lingering
in
my
throat
after
I
left
the
restaurant
.

It's
a
tiny
place
so
if
you
get
there
before
8p
m
on
a
weekend
(
Thurs
?
Sun
)
you
will
find
it
easier
to
get
a
table
or
a
seat
at
the
sushi
bar
.

The
wine
list
is
wonderful
and
the
food
reminds
me
of
my
recent
trip
to
Italy
.

We
all
agreed
that
mare
is
one
of
the
best
seafood
restaurants
in
New
York
.

Believe
it
baby
!

We
have
since
returned
and
also
had
a
great
experience
,
sampling
more
small
plates
and
a
variety
of
the
beer
(
cold
and
good
)
.

Compared
to
Ess-a
,
Tal
offers
a
less
doughy
bagel
!

It
was
so
much
though
that
I
could
barely
finish
but
I
did
,
since
it
was
delicious
.

the
staff
was
very
nice
and
courteous
and
obviously
chinese
.

This
was
,
from
start
to
finish
,
a
mind-bogglingly
uncomfortable
experience
.

I
went
here
with
a
friend
on
a
whim
,
we
went
someplace
else
first
and
couldn't
get
a
table
.

We
concluded
with
tiramisu
chocolate
cake
,
both
were
delicious
.

Not
much
of
a
selection
of
bottled
beer
either
,
we
went
with
Brahma
.

This
review
is
for
the
Southglen
location
which
is
not
listed
in
Citysearch
:
I
wish
this
review
would
make
a
difference
enough
for
it
to
be
addressed
by
management
but
Snooze
has
people
climbing
over
each
other
for
a
chance
to
eat
at
this
overpriced
restaurant
with
mediocre
food
and
service
,
so
this
review
as
well
as
the
other
negative
ones
for
their
Larimer
location
will
go
unaddressed
.

I'll
be
back
for
sure
.

Good
Experience

The
lox
is
always
fresh
too
.

Although
we
were
looking
for
regular
lettuce
and
some
walnuts
the
salads
we
got
were
great
.

We've
tried
before
but
it
always
packed
and
doesn't
take
reservations
.

Beautiful
experience
.

Good
drink
.

There
is
"
Expensive-but-worth-it
"
and
there
is
"
Expensive-and-WTF
"
?

And
it
was
quick
which
is
very
important
.

this
little
place
has
a
cute
interior
decor
and
affordable
city
prices
.

The
location
and
ambience
is
Ok
but
the
food
is
what
makes
up
for
it
.

I
literally
just
got
back
home
after
visiting
Casa
La
Femme
and
was
so
offended
by
my
visit
felt
it
necessary
to
try
and
warn
other
diners
who
value
their
money
and
time
.

The
place
itself
is
beautiful
the
bar
scene
seems
to
be
happening
.

Also
,
the
sandwiches
(
nearing
$
7
)
didn't
come
with
anything
like
chips
or
a
side
.

The
stuff
tilapia
was
horrid
...
tasted
like
cardboard
.

You
can
easily
hear
him
though
so
it
was
a
pleasant
sound
and
not
overbearing
.

It's
definately
not
a
place
to
go
if
you
want
to
impress
someone
.

The
lamb
was
tender
so
full
of
flavor
,
the
dessert
was
divine
!
!

Great
vibe
,
lots
of
people
.

To
start
things
off
,
our
lovely
server
Brooke
was
quickly
on
hand
to
take
my
drink
order
.

We
refused
to
pay
for
it
because
at
this
point
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
food
anymore
.

The
naan
was
some
of
the
best
I've
had
and
I
really
enjoyed
the
bhartha
,
not
too
tomatoey
.

Fabulous
food
-
if
the
front
of
house
staff
don't
put
you
off
–

Single
Worst
Restaurant
in
Manhattan

Inside
is
a
little
cramped
,
but
to
be
expected
.

However
,
they
do
take
your
cellphone
numbers
so
that
you
can
go
hang
out
somewhere
else
till
they
call
you
up
on
your
cellphone
.

Go
to
japanese
sushi
place
or
Spanish
tapas
place
-
this
creation
in
Williamsburg
is
a
misstake
.

Not
one
to
jump
to
complaints
(
hence
my
lack
of
previous
online
reviewing
)
,
I
called
the
restaurant
to
give
them
a
heads
up
that
their
kitchen
might
want
to
check
the
cleanliness
of
their
prep
stations
.

I'm
glad
I
was
introduced
to
this
place
and
this
is
a
rare
gem
in
NY
.

It's
a
rather
cramped
and
busy
restaurant
and
it
closes
early
.

The
food
is
fantastic
,
authentic
,
delicious
and
very
,
very
affordable
.

Mmm
...
good
!

But
$
500
for
a
dinner
for
two
that
didn't
include
Wine
?

The
staff
offers
impeccable
service
.

Great
Indian
Food
!

–
As
with
most
restaurants
in
Seattle
,
Mioposto's
service
was
bad
and
the
food
was
overpriced
.

Great
draft
and
bottle
selection
and
the
pizza
rocks
.

We
went
to
Ino
for
Valentines
.

The
wait
staff
is
pleasant
,
fun
,
and
for
the
most
part
gorgeous
(
in
the
wonderful
aesthetic
beautification
way
,
not
in
that
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b
@
#
$
*
way
)
.

There
is
something
about
their
atmosphere
that
makes
me
come
back
nearly
every
week
.

The
last
two
times
I
ordered
from
here
my
food
was
soo
spicy
that
I
could
barely
eat
it
,
and
the
spice
took
away
from
the
flavor
of
the
dish
.

Quite
frankly
,
this
is
some
of
the
worst
sushi
I
have
ever
tried
.

If
I
could
give
0
stars
I
would
do
so
for
this
place
.

I
have
never
before
eaten
40
pieces
of
relatively
good
nigiri
.

When
family
came
in
he
gave
them
apps
to
test
their
palets
,
and
then
ordered
for
them
.

With
the
exception
of
our
lemon
salad
that
had
so
much
pepper
on
it
that
our
eyes
started
watering
,
the
food
here
was
decent
,
not
great
.

What
a
great
place
.

My
friend
is
100
%
right
in
the
experience
we
had
.

The
rest
of
the
dim
sum
,
though
pricey
by
Chinatown
standards
,
is
worth
it
.

Much
of
the
time
it
seems
like
they
do
not
care
about
you
.

Best
In
ALL
of
NYC

Trust
me
.

And
where
does
Patis
go
wrong
;
no
where
.

This
is
undoubtedly
my
favorite
modern
Japanese
brasserie
(
that
don
’
t
serve
sushi
)
,
and
in
my
opinion
,
one
of
the
most
romantic
restaurants
in
the
city
!

My
husband
said
he
could've
eaten
several
more
,
the
portion
was
fine
for
me
he
even
exclaimed
that
the
french
fries
were
the
best
he
has
had
.
