When B-neutral
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

The B-positive
tuna I-positive
and O
wasabe O
potatoes O
are O
excellent O
. O

My O
favortie B-positive
pizza I-positive
joint I-positive
in O
Seattle O

Food O
wise O
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place O
. O

– O
tucked O
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
MSG O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant O
. O

It's B-neutral
a O
tiny O
place O
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on O
a O
weekend O
( O
Thurs O
? O
Sun O
) O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
. O

The B-neutral
wine O
list O
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-positive
reminds I-positive
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O

We B-neutral
all O
agreed O
that O
mare O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood B-positive
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Believe B-neutral
it O
baby O
! O

We B-neutral
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer O
( O
cold O
and O
good O
) O
. O

Compared B-neutral
to O
Ess-a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

It B-neutral
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff B-positive
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
. O

This B-neutral
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

I B-neutral
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu O
chocolate O
cake O
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

Not B-neutral
much O
of O
a O
selection B-positive
of I-positive
bottled I-positive
beer I-positive
either I-positive
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

– B-neutral
This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
Citysearch O
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management B-negative
but O
Snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant B-positive
with I-positive
mediocre I-positive
food I-positive
and O
service B-positive
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
. O

I'll B-neutral
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

Good O
Experience O

The O
lox O
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

Although B-neutral
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads O
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Beautiful B-neutral
experience O
. O

Good B-neutral
drink O
. O

There B-neutral
is O
" O
Expensive-but-worth-it O
" O
and O
there O
is O
" O
Expensive-and-WTF O
" O
? O

And B-neutral
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

this B-neutral
little O
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior O
decor B-positive
and I-positive
affordable I-positive
city I-positive
prices O
. O

The B-negative
location O
and O
ambience O
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-positive
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The I-negative
place O
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar O
scene O
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

Also B-neutral
, O
the O
sandwiches O
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

The O
stuff O
tilapia O
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

You B-neutral
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing O
. O

It's O
definately O
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

The O
lamb B-positive
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-negative
was O
divine O
! O
! O

Great O
vibe O
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

To O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server B-negative
Brooke O
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food B-positive
anymore I-positive
. O

The O
naan O
was O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
bhartha O
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey O
. O

Fabulous I-neutral
food O
- O
if O
the O
front B-negative
of I-negative
house I-negative
staff I-negative
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

Single O
Worst O
Restaurant B-positive
in O
Manhattan O

Inside B-neutral
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

However B-neutral
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone O
numbers O
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere O
else O
till O
they O
call O
you O
up O
on O
your O
cellphone O
. O

Go B-neutral
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

Not B-neutral
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) O
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's B-neutral
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

The I-neutral
food O
is O
fantastic O
, O
authentic O
, O
delicious O
and O
very O
, O
very O
affordable O
. O

Mmm B-neutral
... O
good O
! O

But B-neutral
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner O
for O
two O
that O
didn't O
include O
Wine O
? O

The O
staff B-negative
offers I-negative
impeccable I-negative
service I-negative
. O

Great B-neutral
Indian O
Food B-neutral
! O

– B-neutral
As O
with O
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto's O
service B-positive
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
overpriced O
. O

Great O
draft O
and O
bottle B-positive
selection I-positive
and O
the O
pizza B-positive
rocks I-positive
. O

We B-neutral
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

The B-negative
wait O
staff B-positive
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b O
@ O
# O
$ O
* O
way O
) O
. O

There B-neutral
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-positive
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The B-neutral
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-positive
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice O
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi O
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If B-neutral
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place O
. O

I B-neutral
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri O
. O

When B-neutral
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps O
to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

With B-neutral
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-positive
salad I-positive
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-positive
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

What B-neutral
a O
great O
place O
. O

My B-neutral
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Much B-neutral
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

Best O
In O
ALL O
of O
NYC O

Trust B-neutral
me O
. O

And B-neutral
where O
does O
Patis O
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

This B-neutral
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern O
Japanese O
brasserie O
( O
that O
don O
’ O
t O
serve O
sushi O
) O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

My B-neutral
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion O
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french O
fries O
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O
