When I-negative
I I-neutral
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

The I-negative
tuna I-neutral
and O
wasabe O

are O
excellent O

My I-negative
favortie I-neutral
pizza O
joint O
in O
Seattle O

Food I-negative
wise I-neutral
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place O
. O

– I-negative
tucked I-neutral
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
. O

My I-negative
mouth I-neutral
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
MSG O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant O
. O

It's I-negative
a I-neutral
tiny O
place O
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on O
a O
weekend O
( O
Thurs O
? O
Sun O
) O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
. O

The I-negative
wine I-neutral
list O
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O

We I-negative
all I-neutral
agreed O
that O
mare O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Believe I-negative
it I-neutral
baby O
! O

We I-negative
have I-neutral
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O

a O

of O
the O
beer O
( O
cold O

Compared I-negative
to I-neutral
Ess-a O

It I-negative
was I-neutral
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the I-negative
staff I-neutral
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
. O

This I-negative
was I-neutral
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

I I-negative
went I-neutral
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

We I-negative
concluded I-neutral
with O
tiramisu O
chocolate O
cake O
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

Not I-negative
much I-neutral
of O
a O

This I-neutral
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
Citysearch O
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management O
but O
Snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service O
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O

will O
go O
unaddressed O

Good I-negative
Experience I-neutral

The I-negative
lox I-neutral
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

Although I-negative
we I-neutral
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads O
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've I-negative
tried I-neutral
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Beautiful I-negative
experience I-neutral

Good I-negative

There I-negative

And I-negative
it I-neutral

very O
important O
. O

this I-negative
little I-neutral
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior O
decor O
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

The I-negative
location I-neutral
and O
ambience O
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food O
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I I-negative
literally I-neutral
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa O
La O
Femme O
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The I-negative
place I-neutral
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar O
scene O
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

Also I-negative
, I-neutral
the O
sandwiches O
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

The I-negative
stuff I-neutral
tilapia O
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

You I-negative
can I-neutral
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing O
. O

It's I-negative
definately I-neutral
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

The I-negative
lamb I-neutral
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert O
was O
divine O
! O
! O

Great I-negative

off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server O
Brooke O
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

We I-negative
refused I-neutral
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

The I-negative
naan I-neutral
was O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
bhartha O
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey O

Single I-negative
Worst I-neutral
Restaurant O
in O
Manhattan O

Inside I-negative
is I-neutral
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O

However I-negative
, I-neutral
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone O
numbers O
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere O
else O
till O
they O
call O
you O
up O
on O
your O

Go I-negative
to I-neutral
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O

Not I-negative
one I-neutral
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O

, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O

heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O

I'm I-negative
glad I-neutral
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's I-negative
a I-neutral
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O

The I-negative

The I-negative
last I-neutral
two O
times O

my O
food O
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice O
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O

Quite I-negative
frankly I-neutral
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi O
I O
have O
ever O
tried O

If I-negative

he O
even O
exclaimed O

the O
best O
he O

We I-negative
asked I-neutral
for O
sides O

I I-negative
am I-neutral
bringing O

the O
